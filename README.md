Hyperbolic snake using p5.js

Use the left and right arrow keys to turn the head.
Please note that the snake turns with respect to the HEAD, it is NOT cardinal directions.
The turn takes place when the key is released, NOT when it is pushed down

Also please note that the snake turns when the key is released, I know this seems counter intuitive, but it shouldn't affect your gameplay.
